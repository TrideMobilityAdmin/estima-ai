100 packages
1. 2 kinds of packages.
    - All source task in one go, first level only
    - One source task (with task# matching pkg category) in level 1 and exploded into level 2
    - Q : no level 3 in source tasks?
2. Discrepancies can be found during source tasks, and can be found during discrepancies also. Q : Is there a fixed number of levels of discrepancies? (practical)
3. Pricing can refer to any task, be it source task or discrepancy.
4. Incremental learning is for future, but from product v0 pov, will include intermediate outputs and source tasks. (APIs need it too)
5. Q : consumption ratio between source task and discrepancies, correlated with package?
6. Q : actual-man-hours of source-tasks includes sub-tasks/children-tasks/discrepancies?
7. 3 kinds of pkg params
    - Flight hour/age/cycle (Q : pattern in amongst hour/age/cycle/user?)
    - Aircraft user/mgf/model
    - Package category (seen to be leading to first level of source tasks)
    - ** all these make sense for source-task decisions at least - need to fix api details
8. 5 kinds of master data
    - Part Master (from table) ex- invariance in desc, uom, price, stock status 
    - Package-Category/Model -> Source Task Master (from table)
    - Reference Manuals (from texts in table, may be required for making others)
    - Actions (from text in table, if difficult will use latent space, explainability issue ~)
    - Failure Modes (from text in table, if difficult use lat. space, explainability issue ~)
    - ** master data is the nouns in our language with user, esp for explainability 
      (read intermediate outputs)
    - We are not provided master data, we are trying to infer from historical data
    - Ds team to work on inferring these first, explore roles of other cols than hrs/qty
